## Features
* **` Responsive design: `** 
  > The web app has been made fully responsive for all screen sizes. On mobile, it will give you a native app vibe.

* **` Real-time chat using websocket: `** 
  > The main attraction of this chat app is its ability to communicate in real-time. I have used socket.io, a popular web socket library, to implement this feature.
